# openheroes2

My attempt of recreating Heroes of Might and Magic 2 game engine using TypeScript and Electron.JS. This is still very WIP.
The only runnable part is map editor and its under active development.

Note: this does not launch without original Heroes2 data files (Heroes2.agg, Heroes2x.agg)

In order to run it, clone repository, copy files from original Heroes2 data directory to ./data/heroes2/* and then:

```
npm install
npm run editor-dev
```

Code comments and refactoring is done every minor milestone.
